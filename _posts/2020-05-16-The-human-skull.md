The skull defends our brain and our sensory organs from the dangerous exterior impacts. It is composed of twenty-eight 
different bones and so is the most complex part of the human skeleton. It is the framework of your head and face. One of 
its role is to provide origin and insertion location for our muscles that we use to change the look of our face. We 
distinguish two main parts of the skull, namely the cranium cerebri and the cranium viscerale. The cranium cerebri contains the brain and it is the upper part of your skull and is composed of 7 bones.    

Bones of the cranium cerebri:
---
Paired bones:

1. os periatale: This makes up the top and side of the skull. (2)

2. os temporale: Can be found on the side of the skull. (2)

Unpaired bones:

3. os occipitale: A saucer-shaped bone that composes the base of the skull and the area of the occiput.(1)

4. os frontale: It composes the forehead and the upper parts of the eye-sockets. At birth it composed of 2 parts that later 
   join together. (1)
   
5. os sphenoidale: The central element of the basis cranii behind the eyes. This large, buttefly-shaped bone is well hidden 
under your os frontale and behind your eyes. (1) 

The *cranium cerebri* has also 2 parts, the upper part is known as the calvaria and is composed of the first, the third and 
the fourth bones. Its shape is gibbous outside and hollow inside. 

The lower part is the *basis cranii* which is the basis or bottom of the cranium cerebri. Many holes (foramen) go through it. Due to them the bones here are weaker and can be broken more easily. The holes are necessary for the blood vessels and nerves. 
The *basis cranii* is built up from the os occipitale, the os sphenoidale, the os temporale and the os frontale.
There are 3 distinguishable inner surface of the *basis cranii*. These are foses (pits) actually. The first is in the direction of your face, it is the fossa cranii anterior. The middle one is deeper and is nearer to your scruff or back. It is the fossa cranii medius. The fossa cranii posterior is the deepest and last. That contains the foramen magnum, through wich the brain is in connection with the vertebral.
   
Bones of the cranium viscerale (facial skeleton):
---
Paired bones:

1. os zygomaticum: Takes part in the building of the wall of the eye-socket. It builds up, with the process of the os temporale the zygomatic arch, which is like a bridge, under which the process of the lower jaw can be found. (2)

2. maxilla: Above your mouth. It includes the hard palate and holds your upper teeth. In addition in makes up the wall of the 
            orbit. (2)

3. os nasale: Two nasal bones joined together at the middle of the face and make up the bridge of the nose. (2)

4. os lacrimale: Element of the eye-socket. The smallest bone of the face. Under it can be found a hole, through which the tears from your eyes can flow into your nose.(2)

5. os palatinum: Two L-shaped bones in the thither-upper part of your mouth. They also border the nasal cavity. (2)

6. Concha nasalis inferiror: something, that is in connection with your maxilla in your nasal cavity. (2)

Unpaired bones:

7. os ethmoidale: Separates the nasal cavity and the brain. That's quite important, isn't it? Can be found between your orbits. (1)

8. vomer: An unpaired bone above the maxilla. This bone separates (with the *os ethmoidale*) the two holes of your nose. The cartilage in your nose is the elongation of this bone. (?)  (1)

+ 1: Mandibula: The largest, strongest and the only movable bone of the face, that holds the lower teeth. (1)

If you count these bones, we have now exactly 22. But the skull has 28 bones. To get the desired number we must not forget 
about the ossicles in the middle ear. There are the malleus (hammer), the incus  and the stapes. We have two ears so 3 times 2 is 6. Now we have 28 bones.
