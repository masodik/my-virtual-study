The scalp is an anatomical area on your head, bordered by your face and neck. On the surface of the sull bones we can find the 
periosteum which is a mebrane. This is the deepest layer of the scalp. It is attached to the bone by strong colagenous fibres.
If we move up, we find the next layer called *loose areolar connective tissue*. It allows the upper parts of the scalp to shift about in realation to the periosteum. By accident this is the place where the layers are teared across. 
The *galea aponeurotika* is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue that connects the the parts of the 'musculus occipitofrontalis'. That is a muscle that you use for instance to pull up your eyebrows or (at the occiput) to pull back your skin on the head. So on the top of your head you can find the aponeurosis, between the temporalis-es(?):) These are the muscles that cover the os temporale.
The aponeurosis is close atteched to the *connective tissue* above it. In it you can find numerous vessels. This layer connects the muscles of the scalp and the *skin*, which is the final layer. There are many hair follicles in it. The skin on your head is the thickest skin on your body.

That's it.
Finally:
*S*-kin
*C*-onnective tissue
*A*-poneurosis
*L*-oose areolar connective tissue
*P*-eriosteum
