Our teeth (dent, dentis) are essential in our nutrition, 'cause with their help we can cut and crush the food before swallowing 
and digesting it.  They are well built in our mandibula and maxilla. An adult usually has 16 teeth in the maxilla and 16 in the 
mandibula. In the case of children, they have only 20 teeth (10-10), until the age of 6, when their primary teeth (dentes 
decidui) start to fall out. During the next few years the child will have mixed teeth. At the end of this period (around age 
12) the child will have only permanent teeth (dentes permanentes). 

Developement
--
Your dentes, even the dentes permanentes are already in your mouth, when you born. The dentes decidui start to develope in the 
womb, between the 6. and 8. week. The dentes permanentes start to come into existence around the 20. week. The eruption starts 
approximately 6 months after the birth, but sometimes there are babies that already born with one or two teeth. 

Structure
--
On the surface of the tooth you can find a layer of *enamel*. This is the most highly mineralized substence of your body. This
is the hardest tissue of the tooth. It is supported by the underlying dentin, with the exception at the edges. At its thickest 
part it can be 2.5 mm wide. It contains no collagen and one of its primary mineral is hydroxyapetite [Ca5(PO4)3(OH)].

The porous, yellow-hued material under the enamel is the *dentin*. It is also a protective layer, but is softer than enamel, 
therefore decays more rapidly. This mineralized connective tissue contains microscopic channels, I do not know why.

The *cementum* is a specialized bone around the dentin. it also contains hydroxyapetite.

In the tooth itself you can find a central part filled with soft connective tissue. It is the dental *pulp*. It contains 
blood vessels and nerves, that enter the tooth ffrom a hole at the apex of the root.

Supporting structure around the tooth:
--
-periodontal fibre
-abveolar bone
-gingiva

Parts of the tooth:
--
We distinguish the crown, the neck and the root.

The types:
--
Each of your teeth has a unique role. 
The insiccors are your front teeth, they cut the food. There are 4 central insiccors and 4 lateral insiccors (2-2 in each 
jaws)

There are 4 canines in the oral cavity. They tear the food.

There are 2 premollars in each quadrant of your mouth. They crush the food.They an have 3-4 cusps.

The mollars are the biggest teeth you have. There are 6 in each jaw, (but it is not rare that the thither ones do not enter the mouth). These teeth have 3 roots. They grind food.
