Title: "About the muscles of the head"

There are numerous thin (or thicker) muscles on our head. We can categorize them according to their role. 

First group: The muscles of mastication
---
Mastication is the process of chewing and crushing the food before swallowing it. There are 4 muscles that help us to do it.

*musculus temporalis*
---
Its origin is in the fossa temporalis, which is a scoop above the ears. So this muscles covers much of the os temporale. 
Its insertion is on the processus coroneideus mandibula. It helps elevating the mandibula.

*musculus masseter*
---

A main muscle that originates on the inner side of the os zygomaticum and inserts at the angle of the lower jaw (manibula).
Helps to squeeze the jaws. 

*musculus pterygoideus medialis*
---

It has two heads. The deep, bigger one arises from above the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone. (No idea where it is)
The smaller, superior head arises from the maxilla and the os palatinum. These heads insert on the medial surface of the mandibule.
Its role is to elevate the mandibule and move it side to side.

*musculus pterygoideus lateralis*
---

This is the muscle that moves our mandibule forward. It has also 2 heads, and inferior and a superior. The superior head originates
from the sphenoid bone. The second (inferior) one runs from the lateral pterygoid plate (which is part of the 
os sphenoidale as well). It inserts at the capsule of the temperomandibular joint. Any question?

Second group: Muscles of facial expression
---
A big topic, huhh. So start with the muscles around your eyes and mouth. The muscle that helps to squeese (close strongly)
your eye is the *musculus obicularis oculi*. It is around your eye. The other muscle that helps to close your mouth firmly 
is the *musculus obicularis oris*. 

So let us go on!

*musculus frontalis*
---
It make sit possible to pucker your brows. It covers your forehead. It runs from the galea aponeurotica and inserts on on
the muscle 
around your eye.

*leviator labii superioris*
---
It's main function is to eleviate the upper lip. It is in connection with the musclus obicularis oculi and musculus 
obicularis oris as well. Its insertion is the skin and muscle of the upper lip.

*zygomaticus minor*
---

It inserts into the outer part of the upper lip.

*zygomaticus major*
---
Helps you to smile, while it inserts into the modiolous of your mouth.

*risorius*
---
You use it when you smile. It helps you to move your mouth laterally.

*triangularis*
---

Its shape is like a triangle, hence its name. It pulls the modiolous of your mouth down.

*depressor labii inferioris*
---
Helps lower the bottom lip.

*mentalis*
---
It allows your lip to pout. It is the "pouting muscle". :)

*musculus nasalis*
---
Allows you to move your nostrils.

There are other muscles on your head, for instence muscles around your ears or nose, but you possibly can not use them.
