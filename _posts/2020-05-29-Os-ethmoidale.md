Title: The ethmoid bone

Our head is made up of several different bones. Among them you can find such that are easy to observe, due to their position 
and function. But there are other bones, like the ethmoid bone, (os ethmoidale) that are even hard to imagine.
The main reason for this is that this bone is "inside" your head, surrounded by other bones.
In this post my goal is to make it more understandable where this bone is, what are its functions and why it is important.
Are you ready? Let's start!

Put it straight, the ethmoid bone is between your eyes. Its lateral sides (lateral means something like sidelong), so its
lateral sides make up partly the wall of the orbit, that contain your eyeballs. This means that this bone is literally connectsto your eyeballs. It separates the eyes. If you could go into your nasal cavity (the space inside your nose), the roof andthe sides of this hollow would be the ethmoid bone. So this bone also separates the nasal cavity from what?... the brain.
Above this bone you will find the brain itself, so in case of a hard blow to your face this bone can be damaged and then 
the liquid that surrounds your brain can start to trickle through your nostrils. That's not good. 

If you watch this bone anteriorly (that means "from the frontal side") its shape is like a cross. There is a longer process
that goes downward and another one that goes upward, these two parts are divided by a horizontal line or plate. And under the 
horizontal part, next to the process that goes downward can be found two so called labyrinths. Can you keep pace with me? 
The process that goes down is called the perpendicular plate. It separates the nasal cavity. Have you noticed that you have 
2 nostrils? The nasal septum which divide your nose is partly made up by this perpendicular plate. In fact, this plate makes up the upper part of the septum and the lower part is a different bone. The labyrinths are next to the perpendicular plate on both sides. They consists of several little hollows or cavities. They are called the ethmoid air cells (or sinus). This cavities are producing mucus that is a viscous material that traps the dust and other pollutant things. There are little holes through which these cavities can drain to the nasal cavity. Therefore you have to sometimes blow your nose. 
The holes are under little, curved, convoluted margins that is called concha. The concha looks like a half shell. Its Latin name has something to do with the shells.You have 3 pairs conchae (plural) in your nose. The Superior Nasal Concha and under them the Middle Nasal Concha are parts of the ethmoid bone.
In contrast the Inferior Nasal Concha is a different bone of your skull.  
So under these conchae you can find the little holes that connect the ethmoid air cells with the nasal cavity. 
These air cells can be divided into 3 parts: anterior (frontal) cells, middle cells and posterior (thither) cells.
The anterior air cells communicate with the space under the middle nasal concha. The space is called the middle meatus
(because it is under the middle nasal concha). There is a groove under the middle nasal concha called the hiatus semilunaris 
and anteriorly to that can be found the hole through which the cells drain under the middle nasal concha. 
The middle air cells drain into the hiatus semilunaris and their most prominent representative is the ethmoid bulla 
which is an air cell, above the hiatus semilunaris. OK... ? The posterior air cells drain into the superior meatus 
under the ...? Under the superior nasal concha. There are 3 conchae and the space under them is called meatus, 
so we can talk about superior, middle and inferior meatus. So the posterior cells drain into the superior meatus. 
There are other cavities in the neighboring bones that also drain into the nasal cavity but they use other channels of course. 

So far we discussed the lower parts of the "cross". We talked about the perpendicular plate (the process that goes downward) 
and the labyrinths next to it (that are made of air cells and conchae). These parts divide the nose (perpendicular plate) and 
frame the side of it (labyrinths). Now let's talk about the roof! The roof is also called plate, it is the cribriform plate 
(lamina cribrosa). There are several holes in it, through that the olfactory nerves travel, that we use to smell.
This plate is like a sieve. The sieve in Greek is ethmos, so hence the name of this bone (os ethmoidale). 
This plate composes the horizontal line of our "cross". 
Above the roof, from the cribriform plate heaves the upper-vertical process of the "cross", as an elongation of the 
perpendicular plate. It is the crista galii. I do not understand its name. It gives place for attachment for the falx cerebri,but I do not know what the latter is. 
The orbital plates were mentioned as parts of the orbit...

The ethmoid bone, due to its central position is connected to several bones. Above it can be found the os frontale that contains a U-shaped hole where the ethmoidale is embedded. The nasal bones (os nasale)  are the reason your can not touch ethmoidale anteriorly. Posteriorly there is the sphenoidale. It connects also to the maxilla, the palatinum, and the lacrimale.
The skull has a base (basis cranii) and the ethmoid bone is part of that, building up partly the anterior cranial fossae. 
(Later about that.)
I hope this explanation helped. If not, let me know!
